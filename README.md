# TableMate

> A comprehensive resource management system for hybrid office environments, developed for Lab Dynamics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**TableMate** is a web-based system designed to streamline office resource management for Lab Dynamics, a technology company with both on-site and remote employees. The project addresses inefficiencies caused by decentralized and manual reservation methods (e.g., paper forms, spreadsheets), offering a modern, integrated digital solution.

Developed by:
- Magdalena Brejna  
- Lidia Łachman  
- Sebastian Bednarski  
- Alan Kaczmarzyk  
- Jakub Urbański

## 🛠️ UML Modeling

Various UML and domain-specific diagrams were used in this project to support analysis and design:

- **BPMN Diagrams** – to model business processes  
- **Use Case Diagrams** – to capture system interactions and user goals  
- **CRC Cards & Sessions (PW-CRC)** – for object responsibility analysis  
- **Class Diagrams (Domain & Design)** – for system architecture  
- **Activity and VOPC Diagrams** – to illustrate system workflows  
- **Deployment Diagram** – to show the system's runtime configuration  
- **Custom Profiles** – created using MDG Technology for specialized modeling

## ✅ Key Features

- **Desk, Conference Room, and Parking Reservation**
  - Create, modify, and cancel bookings
  - Real-time availability search and filtering

- **IT Equipment & Food Ordering**
  - Order IT accessories (e.g., monitor, mouse) with delivery to your desk
  - Order meals delivered directly to your workstation

- **Smart Notifications**
  - Receive confirmations for all reservations and orders
  - Stay updated on status changes

- **Admin Panel**
  - Manage users, assets, vendors, and generate reports
  - Customize notification templates and monitor system activity

The team developed a domain-specific modeling language (PW-CRC), designed custom toolboxes and profiles in Enterprise Architect, and conducted CRC session simulations.
